# CrudProject
Developed a dynamic Product Management System utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The system enables users to manage product data efficiently, with features including:

Real-Time Calculations: Automatically calculates the total price, including taxes, ads, and discounts.
Data Persistence: Stores product data locally using LocalStorage, ensuring data retention across sessions.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search products by title or category, streamlining the process of finding specific entries.
Bulk Operations: Supports the creation of multiple product entries simultaneously and the ability to delete all entries at once.
User-Friendly Interface: Responsive design with intuitive input fields and action buttons for enhanced user experience.
This project demonstrates strong front-end development skills and a solid understanding of JavaScript for manipulating DOM elements and managing data effectively.
